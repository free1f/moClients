This is a basic React application for managing a list of clients. It's been a while since I've worked on a React Project and I had a blast. It's good to go back home. 

Even thought there's a lot of things that we could add to improve the code and the UI, I think this is a good starting point to construct something scalable.
No libraries included (not even sass ðŸ˜µ! <but just because I think it's not really necessary at this point> -- but a must to the near future).

Also, as you might notice, it looks like there's only a dark mode available. The reason behind it is that I just started with the basic template provided by Vite and I just kept it the way it was (but hey! let's be honest... Who doesn't like dark mode? ðŸ¤“)
